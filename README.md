<h4>Helpmate:</h4>
<h5>Shopping made easy</h5>
We are creating this application to get people connected with others to help them out with their shopping needs. 
This application will serve people who can't get out and shop a stores due to scheduling conflicts, disabilities, transportation issues, and other issues.
Shoppers can connect with Helpmates through a portal and submit their request, which can be picked up by other shoppers.
Each helpmate will get a standard fee and an optional tip.
