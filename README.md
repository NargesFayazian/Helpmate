HelpMates: Shopping made easy

We are creating this application to get people connected with others to help them out with their shopping needs. This application will serve people who can't get out and shop a stores due to scheduling conflicts, disabilities, transportation issues, and other issues. Shoppers can connect with Helpmates through a portal and submit their request, which can be picked up by other shoppers. Each helpmate will get a standard fee and an optional tip.
